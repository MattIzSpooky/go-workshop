# Go workshop

Go is an open source statically typed high level language created by Google.

What makes Go special you may ask? In my opinion, Go is a language that prefers simplicity to complexity to solve problems.
It is easy to write multithreaded programs and with low memory usage too when compared to other popular languages such as JavaScript (Node.js), C# (DotNet) or Java (JVM).
